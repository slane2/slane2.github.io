      <h2><center>Machine Language Exercise</center></h2>
      <p>This is an exercise called Simpletron from the Deitel text, "C++: How to Program."
        The program takes four-digit integers, referenced to as "words." Each word is an instruction.
        The first two digits of this word are the instruction digits, they tell the program to read (10),
        write (11), load (20), store (21), add (30), or subtract (31). The last two digits
        reference the memory location of the integers that these instructions will operate on. 
        I've included in the notes at the bottom of the program the needed words to perform addition 
        via machine language.

      <h2><center>Tortoise and the Hare</center></h2>
      <p>This assignment simulates a tortoise and hare race, they each have three moves that they
        are some percent likely to commit. If they land on the same space, "OUCH!" is printed.

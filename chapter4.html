Chapter 4
What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?
<br><br>
        Front ends are the part of the program that interacts with the user. They are visually pleasing and offer the user use of the mouse and the ability to use input and output. In star wars terminology they are C3PO to the back ends R2D2. The back end interacts with the bits. It is all function.

What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?
<br>
        A programming language where you pull whatever pieces you need and connect them to whatever other pieces you need. All of this is prewritten code and allows you to create an entire program without having to write any code, just pick and pull and attach where needed like Legos.
<br><br>
Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.
<br><br>
        There are a lot of variables such as size, function, and number of connections to other components within these "pieces" that make each piece of a program not really representative of a lego because they are not similar enough to be able to pick and pull without writing any of your own code.

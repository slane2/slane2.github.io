Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?
<br>
   Programming pasta. A sort of stream of conscious mess of code.    
<br>
 Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?
<br>
   Didn't help perfect the software of it's day. It did lay the foundation for more ambitious software to come.
<br>
Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process?
<br>
   The software patterns movement which prescribed different approaches to different types of problems, rather than a set-in-stone guideline for everything seems helpful. It looks at each software object separately and allows organization of those objects separately. Appparently it didn't work for larger projects though so maybe the answer is: No.    
<br>
The “waterfall model” of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?
<br>        
   Programmers would either sit idle waiting for the requirements or give up and start design work and coding before they got the requirements. Basically it was disjointed. It didn't build in a way that created a good foundation and it often led to collapse. 
<br>
    What are the four tenets of Agile Software Development?
    <br>
        Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Value working software over comprehensive documentation. Value customer collaboration over contract negotiations. Value responding to change over following a plan.
    <br>
    What did a 2004 study find about the development practices of some two hundred software team leaders?
    <br>
        The most dominant development practice was none at all.
    <br>
    What is the “Joel Test” and what did he say about Microsoft and the Joel Test.
    <br>
        A quick and dirty set of principals based on Joel Spolskys personal experience to judge whether a development organization has its act together or not. Microsoft gets a perfect score.
    <br>
    What is Rosenberg’s Law?
    <br>
        Software is easy to make except when you want it to do something new.

Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?
<br>
   Programming pasta. A sort of stream of conscious mess of code.    
<br>
 Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?
<br>
   Didn't help perfect the software of it's day. It did lay the foundation for more ambitious software to come.
<br>
Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process?
<br>
   The software patterns movement which prescribed different approaches to different types of problems, rather than a set-in-stone guideline for everything seems helpful. It looks at each software object separately and allows organization of those objects separately. Appparently it didn't work for larger projects though so maybe the answer is: No.    
<br>
The “waterfall model” of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?
<br>        
   Programmers would either sit idle waiting for the requirements or give up and start design work and coding before they got the requirements. Basically it was disjointed. It didn't build in a way that created a good foundation and it often led to collapse.

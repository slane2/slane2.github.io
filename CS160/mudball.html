      <h1><center>Big Ball of Mud</center></h1>
    <p>
    Being super new at writing code, it's hard to speak to this. However, I would think that if getting code done in time is necessary for financial backing, then it's more important to have code that is a mess but works and is available to be used and receive feedback would be more important than having code that is structurally neat. However, the code I write usually feels messy to me and I often don't know where to add things without breaking the code altogether. Not sure if this is because I'm a newb or because that's the problem with "spaghetti code" but that seems like it would be a big problem with improving messy code. I guess I don't have a strong sense because I love a beautiful, neatly-organized structure; however the tech industry is fast moving and writing software seems like a "shit or get off the pot" sort of job to me. If you don't come out with something that people can use in a timely manner, someone else probably will.

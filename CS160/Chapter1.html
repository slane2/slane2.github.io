Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.
<br><br>
The cathedral approach, being one where a closed group of individuals obsessively devoted to a single piece of software will create something more cohesive. And the bazaar or "promiscuous" approach where code is openly available to be viewed and added to by whoever can. Less cohesive but with out any forseeable boundary.
<br><br>
Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?
<br><br>
Mostly. The allowance of open tinkering and additions doesn't require other people to stop what they're doing to bring someone else on board and get them up to speed. If someone is interested they get on board through their own study, then add what they can. However that's gotta be pretty messy.

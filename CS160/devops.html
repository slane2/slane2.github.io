DevOps is a development operations culture that is being implemented for technology built using hybrid cloud. Apparently hybrid cloud is a hybrid computing environment of on-premises private cloud and third-party public cloud services. I had to google it. DevOps for hybrid cloud was created with the intention of streamlining some of the clunkier parts of the software development process.</p>

The idea seems to be that companies will stop saying "We're going to release this model of this program on this date", which sets projects up for likely lateness or underperforming models. Instead updates will be automatically applied in a smaller piece by piece fashion so that as the program is being updated in the project it will also be updating for the public. This allows for early user interaction and feedback. It also seems to follow a more natural flow of progress and debugging for the people writing the software. These updates will be ideally happening early and often creating a faster, lowr risk environment for creativity.

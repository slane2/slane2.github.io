Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.
<br><br>
        There is an "and" gate which multiplies two inputs to produce an output (e.g. 1 * 0 = 0). There's an "or" gate which adds two inputes to produce an output (e.g. 0 + 0 = 0). There's a "nand" gate which stands for "not and" which produces the opposite result of an and gate (e.g. 1 * 0=1). And there is a "nor" gate which stands for "not or" and produces the opposite result of an or gate (e.g. 0 + 0 = 1).

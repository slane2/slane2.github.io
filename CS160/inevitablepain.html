Inevitabl Pain covers the inevitable pain of writing code. It discusses the search for a "sivler bullet" or magical system that is ideal for modifying and debugging code without breaking it. The article weighs the pros and cons of attempting a lego-like format of code construction saying essentially that smaller parts are easier to adjust if a problem only affects one part but that if your code were broken into larger pieces it is easier to fix one large broken piece of code than multiple small ones. The main issue with any of this seems to be that no one can know beforehand what modifications will need to be made or what bugs will need to be fixed. If we did we would write the code perfectly the first time around.</p>

There is also reference of the B-L graph which shows that as releases pass, at first bugs decline until the program is effectively smooth, but then as further releases happen the bugs increase possibly exponentially until a program is deemed a lost cause and abondoned by the user. This upswing of bugs seems to happen because all of the past bug fixes have deteriorated the structure of the program to the point that any further modification will lead to its inevitable collapse. Ideally if the planning of a program could be performed flawlessly, then a program could be written with a strong foundation and each link in the chain would connect seamelessly with the next allowing modifications to be done without affecting the programs structural integrity. This seems to be something that no one is able to actually do and the bane of the programmers existence.
